\chapter{Acknowledgements}

This book takes its title, much of its structure, and some of its approach from George Polya's famous \emph{How to Solve It} \cite{polya2004solve}; it takes its existence from a largely abandoned project, started by John Regehr and the author, to write a book on testing, begun in 2013.  Thanks are also due to my wife, Josie Holmes, who pushed me to return to this effort.
